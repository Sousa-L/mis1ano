      <p>
        Do you know the Cearás? <br>
        Just like that, in the plural?
      </p>
      <p>
        This immersive audiovisual installation poses a series of questions to which we have very few answers.       </p>
      <p>
        In this work, the most pleasurable challenge is to take risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental condition of taking risks is to make mistakes. To err and discover, to err again and innovate, to err and subvert, in short, to err and learn.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">
        This Museum is infinite, as well as the many Cearás.
      </p>
      <p>
        The installation embraces us and takes us to the epicenter of these expanded screens, featuring powerful projectors aimed at all possible surfaces and ambisonic sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a dive. Nothing is certain and conclusive in this work. Nor is it intended to be definitive, so don't be surprised if you lose ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        The immersive audiovisual experience is one of the possibilities to free ourselves from reality. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You, spectator-actor, are a flyer who will act alongside the story that is being told, always being inside it. So let yourself fly. Fly. Don't limit yourself to seeing and hearing. Use a poetic jargon from the Pantanal that says: “If you want to see, listen”. Shuffle your senses and try to <span class="bold">LISEETEN</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a restless, intuitive, undisciplined way, but always grounded, here are several artistic fragments collectively sewn in handmade-digital confection by us and by the chosen artists from Ceará with their respective works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enchanted by the charm during the trips to the many Cearás that I have known, I heard one of the most exuberant images: <span class="bold">Tá Bonito Pra Chover.²</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        It has urgency, vitality, imagination and poetry. It is possible to close your eyes and listen to the rain in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        This inaugural artistic project that houses the installation <span class="bold">ONTEM CHOVEU NO FUTURO</span> has a complementary training project to the master class <span class="bold">EU ME INTERESSO PELAS COISAS QUE NUNCA FIZ³</span>, held at the inauguration of this space, as well as an immersive atelier <span class="bold">MESTRE É QUEM DE REPENTE APRENDE<sup>4</sup></span> where we share our entire technical-creative process with local artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The educator and revolutionary <span class="bold">Paulo Freire</span>, with his pedagogy of autonomy (and curiosity), stated: <span class="bold">“Let us learn by teaching ourselves.”</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The process of creation and construction was and will always be done by a collective of knowledge of people who complement each other with their powers and limitations for a loving delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work is intentionally unfinished because it has no beginning and will never end. Enter whenever you want and never leave. This work is a journey of great availability, and also ruptures, affections, bridges to better see another world. A world that does not yet exist, but which we will never give up building.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has urgency, vitality, imagination and poetry. It is possible to close your eyes and listen to the rain in the future.

        <sup>2</sup> “It’s a Beautiful Sky For The Rain To Come”  in free translation. In the northeast of Brazil, the expression "It's beautiful for something to happen" is often used to refer to the weather when the rain is coming.
