      </h1>
      <p id="title">Silas de Paula</p>
      <p>
        The Ceará Museum of Image and Sound Chico Albuquerque¹, inaugurated in 1980 and installed in the basement of the Governor Menezes Pimentel Public Library building, was restructured on August 7, 1996 in its current headquarters, located at Barão de Studart Avenue, 410. In this process, it had its collection expanded by receiving equipment and documents from the Cultural Reference Center (CERES)², in addition to a collection of films from TV Educativa³.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old house where the museum is placed was designed by the architect José Barros Maia to be the residence of Senator Fausto Augusto Borges Cabral, inaugurated in November 1951. Expropriated by the State Government, it was made the headquarters of the Ceará Anthropological Museum, which operated there until 1990 , giving way to MIS in 1996. In 2018, it underwent restructuring with the construction of a square and a five-story building, designed by architect José Manuel Carvalho Araújo.       </p>
      <p>
        Celebrating year one of its [re]inauguration on March 31, 2022, carried out by Governor Camilo Santana and Secretary of Culture Fabiano Piuba, MIS seeks, more and more, to be a space that puts memory and contemporaneity in a lively dialogue, together with technical-scientific research and increased access to innovations in the field of image and sound. By integrating memory and contemporaneity, the Museum preserves and stimulates cultural production in the state of Ceará, sharing and interacting with all interested publics, without neglecting to document and the conservation of important artistic legacies. These policies are linked to its vocation, maintaining a research environment that allows the sustainability and quality of the institution's technical, educational, training and entertainment processes. Expanding access to cultural assets in their plurality and in line with the new languages ​​of contemporary art, MIS encourages looks at the artistic and cultural, as well as effectively updates its role as a museum, directing its actions to create an environment effervescent with an eye toward memory and the new.

        The fundamental condition of taking risks is to make mistakes. To err and discover, to err again and innovate, to err and subvert, in short, to err and learn.
      </p>

        Conceptually, we proposed Sympoiesis, which means “to do with”, as the maximum category of the process. Remembering Donna Haraway (2016) in her book Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene<sup>4</sup>,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>
        [...] Nothing makes itself; nothing is really autopoietic or self-organizing. In the words of the Inupiat computer “world game,” earthlings are never alone.  That is the radical implication of sympoiesis. Sympoiesis is a word proper to complex, dynamic, responsive, situated, historical systems. It is a word for worlding-with, in company. Sympoiesis enfolds autopoiesis and generatively unfurls and extends it.      
      </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        A public museum belongs to the communities and they are the ones who will provide continuous support if they are part of the process – communities, in the plural, to face the challenges of breaking with the selective treatment of heritage assets and the cult of generic identity (inflation of historical heritage) that do not emphasizes the heterogeneity of cultures. Museums are not-for-profit, participatory, transparent and work in active partnership with diverse groups to collect, preserve, research, interpret, display and enhance understandings of the world, with the aim of contributing to human dignity, social justice, well-being and equality globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we intend is to emphasize the information/education provided by MIS, which also has the task of making artistic and social messages available to its public, building more democratic experimental processes and placing a question mark on conservative structures. The biggest challenge has been how and what to make available to the public. In addition to internal proposals, it is also necessary to receive demands and build more inclusive processes, placing a question mark on conservative structures. Our greatest challenge is to listen and work together with the different groups that have been made invisible in a perennial process of non-attention. We believe that with our acquired technologies, a creative team and open spaces without exclusion, we can move on not forgetting the past, but relating it to the future and the role of MIS in contemporary times.      </p>
      <p>
        The Museum, in addition to having its interdisciplinary collection policy with a view to preservation, is also a laboratory, a space for critical experimentation that seeks a focus for its performance. Image and sound are the pillars that guide us, and we understand that they are inserted in very broad perspectives. It is not easy and it is a work in progress. It is necessary to create partnerships, provide services and seek sponsorships. In the creative processes, art and technology are ways to think with images and sounds and, with that, to resist – but this resistance emerges as an imagery/sound problem.It is not a way of resisting by transmitting messages or raising awareness about ways of being in the world. This is not a relationship created out of image and sound. It is fundamental to grasp the aesthetic object in bodies, gestures, postures, as a thought-producing process, as a way of thinking with sound images that promote interferences and transformations to break with conservative structures of the past and move collectively towards an equitable future.
