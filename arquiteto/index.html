      <p id="title">Silas de Paula</p>
      <p>
        On March 25, 2022, we started a new trip to Fortaleza. It was the same as we did with our previous trips. The same ritual: first, the choice of transport and second, the organization of our itinerary. Both added to other pre-workday organizational habits and customs. What to eat, talk and decide. These moments always seem to be an opportunity to sort out our ideas. But this trip was made with a different expectation. Accompanying the realization of a set of works that had the magnitude and dimension that would have the MIS¹, the Complexo Cultural Estação das Artes² and the Centro Cultural do Cariri³ was not a simple and commonplace activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, we expected the possibility of renewing our enthusiasm for a process that had already taken a long time, and also of remembering the ideas and ways of occupying the place that motivated us to build those spaces. We always think that we learn something more in these works and that it serves to take advantage of the next ones. Even so, there are always new variables, other times and people. New challenges require a mix of security in cumulative knowledge, along with the spontaneity of starting from scratch.       <p>
        Celebrating year one of its [re]inauguration on March 31, 2022, carried out by Governor Camilo Santana and Secretary of Culture Fabiano Piuba, MIS seeks, more and more, to be a space that puts memory and contemporaneity in a lively dialogue, together with technical-scientific research and increased access to innovations in the field of image and sound. By integrating memory and contemporaneity, the Museum preserves and stimulates cultural production in the state of Ceará, sharing and interacting with all interested publics, without neglecting to document and the conservation of important artistic legacies. These policies are linked to its vocation, maintaining a research environment that allows the sustainability and quality of the institution's technical, educational, training and entertainment processes. Expanding access to cultural assets in their plurality and in line with the new languages ​​of contemporary art, MIS encourages looks at the artistic and cultural, as well as effectively updates its role as a museum, directing its actions to create an environment effervescent with an eye toward memory and the new.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would this trilogy of cultural facilities, of which the MIS is the touchstone, have the impact on the cultural panorama in Ceará that we aspired to?
      </p>
      <p>
        In Fortaleza, our first days are filled with the same rituals among the occasional news. The morning walk along the waterfront to the church of São Pedro dos Pescadores; the commentary on the changing boardwalk; the longing for a dip in the immense sea; mouth filling with saliva for a moqueca at La Vilany; among other appreciations and visits.      </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>
        On the morning of the 29th, the curtain goes up! The first temporary fence panels for the work are beginning to be removed. It was a special moment. The rain came to greet us and a friendly shelter in the Abolition Palace guardhouse was made available to us. Together with the military on duty, we watched the fences slowly fall down. We held an umbrella in one hand and a camera in the other.
      </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Gradually we explained to the military at the Palácio da Abolição what the MIS was. We said that there were two more floors underground, and that there was no fence. Under the bleachers it was possible to see some workrooms; that the concrete wall was a huge screen for cinema and that it was possible to enter under this large wall through a low “window”, where the reception was located.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surprise of those experiencing that moment of revelation gave us renewed confidence. It was the childish intonation of that soldier with an emotional look who exclaimed “true! there's all that!”, like an enchanted word of Brazilian phrasing, which allowed us to realize that the proposal for the new MIS building would fulfill the expectations we wanted. There, the architect's critical eye, which seeks to correct the error and improve every detail, succumbs with the fall of the last fence of the work. In slow motion, the new MIS assumed its position in the urban space.      <p>
        The Museum, in addition to having its interdisciplinary collection policy with a view to preservation, is also a laboratory, a space for critical experimentation that seeks a focus for its performance. Image and sound are the pillars that guide us, and we understand that they are inserted in very broad perspectives. It is not easy and it is a work in progress. It is necessary to create partnerships, provide services and seek sponsorships. In the creative processes, art and technology are ways to think with images and sounds and, with that, to resist – but this resistance emerges as an imagery/sound problem.It is not a way of resisting by transmitting messages or raising awareness about ways of being in the world. This is not a relationship created out of image and sound. It is fundamental to grasp the aesthetic object in bodies, gestures, postures, as a thought-producing process, as a way of thinking with sound images that promote interferences and transformations to break with conservative structures of the past and move collectively towards an equitable future.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, the crowd was waiting for a slogan for the beginning of the inauguration of the MIS, without realizing that this was already being done. People were already sitting in the bleachers, seeing the immense projection of images from the concrete facade and posing as a catwalk in front of the screen, where the videographic image of the MIS was running in the background. That way, they circulated freely in the square, not knowing that they were doing so above the main room, which occupied two floors in the basement.
      </p>
      <p>
        They realized that the setback of the building created a preparation space that intensified the experience of revealing the interior of the building. The crowd was in awe. After touring the interiors, everyone seemed surprised to discover this unanticipated news. The small annex contained more than seemed possible. Would that be the greatness and charm of MIS? I noticed the moon shining brightly, which reminded me of someone saying that the Estação das Artes Cultural Complex is for daytime viewing and the MIS at night. Maybe... The penumbra, of course, makes the MIS a more intimate environment and at night everything takes on a certain splendor. Perhaps the MIS is destined to create light and the Estação das Artes to receive it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We felt enormous responsibility for what was to come out of this new building. The Palácio da Abolição complex is a beautiful example of architecture and we didn't want the MIS to stand out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new MIS project was a request for the construction of an annex building to the MIS-CE, already existing on Avenida Barão de Studart. A place destined to preserve archives, operate administrative services and complement them with technical areas that the existing house could not accommodate due to its reduced size.      
      </p>
      <p>
        What appeared to be a minor order was an exciting challenge for us. Supported by the idea that we were developing just one annex, we advanced in the concept of a complementary building, subaltern to the existing MIS-CE and “haunted” by the importance and beauty of the Palácio da Abolição complex. The latter is located on the other side of the street, on the block in front.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was based on dialogue and respect for MIS-CE, Palácio da Abolição and their position in the urban context (in the midst of residential towers whose height we knew we would never surpass), that the project advanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the studio we called this project MIS | SIM4. It was, in fact, one of the first sketches made for him, playing with the graphic symmetry of the anagram. SIM for the possibility, for the challenge, for this mirror image, alter-ego of the existing building. SIM for the space of freedom, space of culture of opportunity where everything would be possible. SIM, because we intended to go a little further than what was asked of us. Finally, because we were embraced by Ceará and Fortaleza, where we made friends with a great openness to discovery and experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rian took us around the old town. From his shed, his world, the place where his art is produced, we talked about the hidden, ancient, forgotten city. Greater wealth of Fortaleza that we were interested in recovering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MIS carries the importance of its journey already made in Fortaleza, which precedes and justifies it. There would be no MIS ambition without understanding the city, nor the charm that the historic city exerted on us. Much less without the idea that this knowledge should be disseminated and shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting in a pub next to the former Escola Jesus, Maria e José, located in the heart of the historic city, we had intense conversations with Tiago and Silas about the E33 project and the passions of this forgotten city, uniting them with the imagined city. We were talking about how it was necessary to make this evidence, in fact, evident. It is important for us that MIS has the ability to communicate the city to people, highlighting its historical processes and creating new developments, based on image and sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        We dreamed of an idea. We even thought about investing in the pub next to the E33, doing a small project, which was just a symbolic act of the commitment and enthusiasm we were having, and not a material and concrete ambition. The urban structure of Fortaleza had a potential that inspired us, and in particular, its historic center. We said that there was a lot to do, but that Fortaleza was a unique city for us to meet this challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        There would be no MIS without the idea that it was fundamental to have a place where we could think and rediscover what Fortaleza communicates to us. It is necessary to find in the multiple urban identities a reference for popular participation in defining the places where we want to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        We relied on the concept of urban scale for the MIS project. We wanted to create a platform for valuing the public space that was open, without fences, in a dialogue with the surroundings. The project was thought to function as a piece of urban furniture, in which the first room of the set was in the outer space, with an accessible and public utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The small annex began to gain scale, autonomy and identity. Suddenly, the paradigm changed. The building started to reveal the quality of desirable spaces, starting to accommodate more exhibition programs instead of administrative and secondary spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        An inner world is revealed from the atrium: a long room, open to the square and the stands from a low window, under the concrete screen. This space organizes and distributes the relationship between the light and shadow MIS. It ranges from the MIS that rises three floors above the street, with vertical windows that dialogue with residential towers on the back facade, to the MIS that is revealed underground and is protected from light, in intimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind the back wall of the atrium, a linear staircase transports us without barriers to two floors below, along with some light coming from the windows, which gradually fades. We enter the large double-height exhibition space, below the square, which becomes a space for video mapping projection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around it are two floors containing archives, document preservation, darkrooms, régie, technical rooms, meeting rooms and support for the performance of the central space. These are organized in a ring corridor, whose ends connect the stairs, elevators and a large freight elevator for transporting large items, to a side service entrance with independent exit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ascent is different. A hidden staircase takes refuge in the shadows, creating a contrast that intensifies the climax of the visitor's encounter with the natural light of the two upper rooms: a library and an exhibition room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The delicate balance of light from the rhythmic windows frames an urban landscape that reveals itself, as the background scenery of the rooms and accentuates the jagged glow. The interior is fully exposed. A rhythm of pillars rises as the main composition of the facade, overlooking the roof, as if they were a portico intended to support the large concrete wall of that facade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concrete "sculpture" is clearly separated here, folded in a vertical and horizontal plane like a sheet of paper, which autonomously establishes the outdoor space of urban events. The latter makes up the stands and the stage, which differ from the volume behind , containing the spaces of the upper rooms. It has a dark color finish, so that it cancels out like any technical space behind a scene, or a stage that one wants to show.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program evolved, which led to changes and adjustments for better execution and results. Even so, the project preserved the main convictions that accompanied it from the first ideas, oriented towards the creation of an adjacent, smaller building.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was always understood as a large outdoor living room. A carpet laid out and created to inspire a performative setting. In the end, it continued to be a shaped complement to the existing main house, accommodated at the edge of the land, set back, minimizing the impact of the height of a neighboring housing tower, and creating this new square in front, with bleachers facing the vertical screen of concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, on the other side of the Atlantic, the light of the MIS reaches us every day. Images, videos and news of the dynamism of programming and use of spaces show us the realization of these imagined potentialities and the announcement of others to be discovered. The MIS | SIM is now delivered to the city of Fortaleza. We just hope that Fortaleza surrenders to the MIS.
